- implement the 'add' request.
- restrict the 'rdiff' command to one module
- more test code for 'static' directories
- remove command: does not check for still existing files. should this be done in
  the internal listener or is the user to provide this listener? Currently use it with
  the force flag.

check the places in the sources which are marked with TODO
